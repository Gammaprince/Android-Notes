when composable goes off screen then onDispose method will be called of disposableEffect , or key changes then previous scope will be cancelled and disposableEffect will be 
  called again

  @Composable
  fun Screen(){
    DisposableEffect(key1 = Unit){
      override onDispose(){
        // This will be called to perform cleanups , this will also called if Screen is no more visible so that developer can perform cleanups
      }
    }
  }
