using const in kotlin has better advantage here it is why 

suppose you are creating a variable

object Constant{
    val name = "Prince"
}

// we are now accessing this name from Constant

val name = Constant.name 

this is kotlin bytecode -> String name = Constant.INSTANCE.getName() , here it is calling a function which is a call overhead. which will create extra overhead runtime.

suppose now we are creating this same  variable using const

const val name = Constant.name 

this is jvm code -> String name = "Prince" , here no extra call overhead , no function called as it has been inlined which lead to better performance.
