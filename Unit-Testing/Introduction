Unit testing is important to test functionality in isolation

there are two type of testing 
1-> kotlin/java (pure logic) based , can be tested with JVM(Desktop only - JUnit)
2-> For Android tests , we need device (instrumentation Test)
3-> Android Tests can be further divided into UI Tests (Espresso) and Non-UI Test

Unit Testing 
 -> JVM Test( Local Unit Test)
 -> Android Test(instrumentation)
       -> UI Based
       -> Non-UI Based
